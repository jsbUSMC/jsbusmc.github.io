title: Observing Humanity Through Code
tags: [GitHub]
---

I am not a typical programmer. I haven't had much technical training/education in authoring 
applications. I had a couple of Java classes in college awhile back, but that was in 2010 and 
2011...and frankly I didn't do very well. It wasn't until much later that my interest was 
rekindled. Since then, about a year and a half ago, I have entirely self-taught in C#, JavaScript,
and Python. I took two workshops through my University's [Center for Integrated Research Computing][1] 
for both Python and R. However, the vast majority of my fledgling experience has been with C# 
and Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC web framework.

This post though, will not be technical at all, but focus on something that touched me very greatly
while working on a side-project for work, a Line-of-Business application I've called FlowState. It is
an ASP.NET MVC application that is based on the awesome [Serenity][2] framework by [@volkanceylan][3].
The Serenity framework is an amazing work, in my eyes, not just because it is easy to pick up and make something
incredible with it, but also because of the work that the author put into not just the framework, but 
especially the documentation. He has authored a guide, the [Serenity Developer's Guide][4] on gitbook.io
that is almost 450 pages long (in PDF output). Additionally, he provides a template project that is concurrently
updated with the framework itself, and a few tutorial projects. As of this writing, the Serenity framework is at
version 2.4.3. When I first stumbled across it, it was at version 1.8.8. Since then, the number of apparent users
according to the activity in the [Issues page][5] has grown dramatically.

And this is where I get to the gist (terrible GitHub pun intended) of this post. There are many users from around the
world who are all busy creating apps, that have questions/issues/bugs that they encounter and use the Issues page 
as a quasi-forum for assistance. @volkanceylan is very timely with his responses, and there are a few other knowledgeable
people on the site who are also willing to lend a hand to help someone out with a problem. This in and of itself would
not be remarkable, since the community of developers is, generally speaking, helpful by nature. Our craft is a 
difficult one, and nobody gets anywhere entirely on their own - statistical outliers notwithstanding, as I'm sure there's
at least someone, somewhere, who has become an expert in software engineering who managed to never need someone's help.

What struck me though on this particular occasion, is when I logged into my GitHub account and checked the notifications 
that I hadn't read, and found [this issue][6]. It was posted on July 15<sup>th</sup>, and for those who haven't yet viewed 
the issue, the title is simply: ***Stay Safe, Volkan***. July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2016 was the day of the 
[attempted coup d'état in Turkey][7]. This is relevant because Volkan is Turkish, and his GitHub account states that he 
works for the [Marmara University][8] in Istanbul, which is where a major portion of the uprising occurred. It is worth 
noting that the creator of the issue, [@wdhodges][9], is American. Some of the others who posted messages of support include 
citizens of India, Spain, Brazil, and Bangladesh.

GitHub is not, by any strict standards, a social network. There are options to follow users, or to follow the activities of
specific repositories, but the social functions of the site are limited. There is no concept of "friends" per se. The 
action of following another user only alerts one to new activity of that user in the activity feed of one's homepage. 
Also, there is no direct/private messaging system, either. GitHub is first and foremost a system that hosts repositories
of software, that uses the [git][10] distributed version control system at its core. The intent of the website is not to be
a social hangout for people interested in software engineering, but for anyone interested in software engineering or design
to have a place to share their code with one another and the community. In this vein, while it is possible to have many
interactions with the same users over a period of time working together on a project or library, the system maintains the
focus on the code. Seeing the outpouring of support for the author of this library showed that even though we don't know 
anything about each other besides the fact that we are all developing in ASP.NET, there's still the common bond of 
humanity, and that remains strong despite thin ties.
