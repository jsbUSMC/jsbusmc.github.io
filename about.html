      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is John S. Bissonette. I am a student of the University of Rochester, in the
        B.S. Data Science program. I am an aspiring Data Scientist, interested in the vagaries of
        analysis of large datasets and machine learning. Professionally, my history is as a network/system 
        administrator and data center operations analyst. Last, but certainly not least, I am a 
        veteran of the United States Marine Corps, serving from 2005 &mdash; 2010.
