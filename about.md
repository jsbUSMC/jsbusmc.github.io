# Personal Bio

My name is John S. Bissonette. I am a student at the University of Rochester studying for my Bachelor's of Science in Data Science.
I am also an employee of the University, working for University IT, at the Enterprise Data Centers as a Senior Operations Analyst.
My professional background is in enterprise IT, primarily as a system and network administrator. Branching out into Data Science is
the direction I would like to take my career, as I have seen a fundamental shift in my interests within the field - from fixing things
to building them.
